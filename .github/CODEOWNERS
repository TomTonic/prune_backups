# To protect a repository fully against unauthorized changes,
# you also need to define an owner for the CODEOWNERS file
# itself. The most secure method is to define a CODEOWNERS
# file in the .github directory of the repository and define
# the repository owner as the owner of either the CODEOWNERS
# file (/.github/CODEOWNERS @owner_username) or the whole
# directory (/.github/ @owner_username).
